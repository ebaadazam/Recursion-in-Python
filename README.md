## Recursion-in-Python
#### Python recursion is a technique of defining a function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly. Recursion can be useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller and simpler subproblems. However, recursion also has some drawbacks, such as high memory and time consumption, difficulty in debugging, and risk of stack overflow.
