## Recursion
#### Python recursion is a technique of defining a function that calls itself, either directly or indirectly. Recursion can be useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller and simpler subproblems. However, recursion also has some drawbacks, such as high memory and time consumption, difficulty in debugging, and risk of stack overflow.
#### The code for all the recursion programs has been written by me along with suitable comments for others to understand it without any problem. All the programs are present in one file named 'Recursion.py' in the following repository. 
#### I have made various recursion related programs in python. Some of them are as follows:
1) Finding the factorial of a number
2) Sum of n Natural Numbers
3) Sum of digits
4) Power of a number
5) Count the number of digits in a number
6) Finding the first uppercase letter in a string
7) Palindrome String
8) Armstrong Number
9) Check whether the number is prime or not
10) Find miminum and maximum element from an array
